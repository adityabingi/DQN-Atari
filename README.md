# DQN-Atari
Tensorflow implementation (both tf1 and tf2) of Deep Q Network for Atari Video Games.

This work is the reproduction of hugely popular nature paper [Human-level control through deep reinforcement learning](https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/dqn/DQNNaturePaper.pdf). This paper is one of the major breakthroughs in the field of Deep Reinforcement Learning and it succeeded in applying Q learning to the challenging domain of atari games. In this repo I tried to reproduce the DQN algorithm introduced in the paper and successfully trained it on atari games like Breakout.
